# Speech-Emotions-Detector
ðŸ“– Description:

This project is a Speech Emotion Detection (SED) system that analyzes audio recordings and classifies them into different emotional categories (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.). It uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to extract features from speech and predict emotions.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, numpy, librosa, scikit-learn, etc.)
Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)
Feature Extraction (MFCC, Mel-Spectrogram)
Audio Processing (Librosa, Wave, Soundfile)
Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
